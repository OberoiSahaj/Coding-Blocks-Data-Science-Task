This is my first attempt with Scrapy.
This repo includes 2 spiders- 
1. spider1.py : This is the very first attempt with Scrapy to get quotes from http://quotes.toscrape.com
2. amazon_spider.py : This is the attempt to achieve what Prateek Sir wanted, i.e Extracting name, price and ratings of the mobiles on Amazon.in
